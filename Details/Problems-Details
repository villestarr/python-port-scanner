Problems Faced & Fixes
Python Not Installed or Not in PATH
Fixed by installing Python and ensuring the "Add Python to PATH" option was selected during installation.

Running Scripts in the Wrong Environment
Initially ran install commands and scripts inside the Python interactive shell, which caused syntax errors. Fixed by running commands in the system terminal/command prompt.

File Path Issues in Command Prompt
Errors like "Cannot find the path specified" occurred due to spaces in folder names and incorrect navigation. Fixed by enclosing paths in quotes when using the cd command.

All Ports Showing as Closed
This is often caused by firewalls, scanning the wrong IP, or no services running on scanned ports. Tested by scanning known open ports (e.g., Google's DNS at 8.8.8.8 port 53).

Skills Learned
Using Python's socket library for network communication

Writing basic network scanning tools (port scanner)

Handling user input and exceptions in Python

Navigating and troubleshooting command line interfaces (CMD, PowerShell)

Understanding TCP ports and how network services respond

Debugging common installation and path errors in Python projects

Next Steps (Suggestions)
Add multithreading to scan multiple ports faster

Save scan results to a file

Implement scanning of IP ranges instead of single IPs

Add a graphical user interface (GUI) for ease of use

Integrate with other network tools for deeper scanning and reporting
